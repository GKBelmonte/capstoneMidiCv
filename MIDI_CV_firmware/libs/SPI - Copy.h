  Bit 7:4 � CCxEN: Compare or Capture Enable
Setting these bits in the FRQ or PWM waveform generation mode of operation will override the port output register for the
corresponding OCn output pin.
When input capture operation is selected, the CCxEN bits enable the capture operation for the corresponding CC
channel.
  Bit 3 � Reserved
This bit is unused and reserved for future use. For compatibility with future devices, 
always write this bit to zero when this register is written.


 Bit 2:0 � WGMODE[2:0]: Waveform Generation Mode
These bits select the waveform generation mode, and control the counting sequence of the counter, TOP value,
UPDATE condition, interrupt/event condition, and type of waveform that is generated according to Table 13-4.
No waveform generation is performed in the normal mode of operation. For all other modes, the result from the waveform
generator will only be directed to the port pins if the corresponding CCxEN bit has been set to enable this. The port pin
direction must be set as output.

  Bit 7:5 � EVACT[2:0]: Event Action
These bits define the event action the timer will perform on an event according to Table 13-5 on page 160.
The EVSEL setting will decide which event source or sources have control in this case.

Selecting any of the capture event actions changes the behavior of the CCx registers and related status and control bits
to be used for capture. The error status flag (ERRIF) will indicate a buffer overflow in this configuration. See �Event
Action Controlled Operation� on page 150 for further details.

  Bit 4 � EVDLY: Timer Delay Event
When this bit is set, the selected event source is delayed by one peripheral clock cycle. This is intended for 32-bit input
capture operation. Adding the event delay is necessary to compensate for the carry propagation delay when cascading
two counters via the event system.

  Bit 3:0 � EVSEL[3:0]:Timer Event Source Select
These bits select the event channel source for the timer/counter. For the selected event channel to have any effect, the
event action bits (EVACT) must be set according to Table 13-6. When the event action is set to a capture operation, the
selected event channel n will be the event channel source for CC channel A, and event channel (n+1)%8, (n+2)%8, and
(n+3)%8 will be the event channel source for CC channel B, C, and D.

13.12.8 CTRLFCLR/CTRLFSET � Control register F Clear/Set
This register is mapped into two I/O memory locations, one for clearing (CTRLxCLR) and one for setting the register bits
(CTRLxSET) when written. Both memory locations will give the same result when read.
The individual status bit can be set by writing a one to its bit location in CTRLxSET, and cleared by writing a one to its bit
location in CTRLxCLR. This allows each bit to be set or cleared without use of a read-modify-write operation on a single
register.

? Bit 1 � LUPD: Lock Update
When this bit is set, no update of the buffered registers is performed, even though an UPDATE condition has occurred.
Locking the update ensures that all buffers, including DTI buffers, are valid before an update is performed.
This bit has no effect when input capture operation is enabled.
? Bit 0 � DIR: Counter Direction
When zero, this bit indicates that the counter is counting up (incrementing). A one indicates that the counter is in the
down-counting (decrementing) state.
Normally this bit is controlled in hardware by the waveform generation mode or by event actions, but this bit can also be
changed from software.
13.12.9 CTRLGCLR/CTRLGSET � Control register G Clear/Set
Refer to �CTRLFCLR/CTRLFSET � Control register F Clear/Set� on page 162 for information on how to access this type
of status register.
? Bit 7:5 � Reserved
These bits are unused and reserved for future use. For compatibility with future devices, always write these bits to zero
when this register is written.
? Bit 4:1 � CCxBV: Compare or Capture x Buffer Valid
These bits are set when a new value is written to the corresponding CCxBUF register. These bits are automatically
cleared on an UPDATE condition.
Note that when input capture operation is used, this bit is set on a capture event and cleared if the corresponding CCxIF
is cleared.
? Bit 0 � PERBV: Period Buffer Valid
This bit is set when a new value is written to the PERBUF register. This bit is automatically cleared on an UPDATE
condition.
13.12.10INTFLAGS � Interrupt Flag register
? Bit 7:4 � CCxIF: Compare or Capture Channel x Interrupt Flag
The compare or capture interrupt flag (CCxIF) is set on a compare match or on an input capture event on the
corresponding CC channel.
For all modes of operation except for capture, the CCxIF will be set when a compare match occurs between the count
register (CNT) and the corresponding compare register (CCx). The CCxIF is automatically cleared when the
corresponding interrupt vector is executed.
For input capture operation, the CCxIF will be set if the corresponding compare buffer contains valid data (i.e., when
CCxBV is set). The flag will be cleared when the CCx register is read. Executing the interrupt vector in this mode of
operation will not clear the flag.

The flag can also be cleared by writing a one to its bit location.
The CCxIF can be used for requesting a DMA transfer. A DMA read or write access of the corresponding CCx or
CCxBUF will then clear the CCxIF and release the request.
? Bit 3:2 � Reserved
These bits are unused and reserved for future use. For compatibility with future devices, always write these bits to zero
when this register is written.
? Bit 1 � ERRIF: Error Interrupt Flag
This flag is set on multiple occasions, depending on the mode of operation.
In the FRQ or PWM waveform generation mode of operation, ERRIF is set on a fault detect condition from the fault
protection feature in the AWeX extention. For timer/counters which do not have the AWeX extention available, this flag is
never set in FRQ or PWM waveform generation mode.
For capture operation, ERRIF is set if a buffer overflow occurs on any of the CC channels.
For event controlled QDEC operation, ERRIF is set when an incorrect index signal is given.
This flag is automatically cleared when the corresponding interrupt vector is executed. The flag can also be cleared by
writing a one to this location.
? Bit 0 � OVFIF: Overflow/Underflow Interrupt Flag
This flag is set either on a TOP (overflow) or BOTTOM (underflow) condition, depending on the WGMODE setting.
OVFIF is automatically cleared when the corresponding interrupt vector is executed. The flag can also be cleared by
writing a one to its bit location.
OVFIF can also be used for requesting a DMA transfer. A DMA write access of CNT, PER, or PERBUF will then clear the
OVFIF bit.
13.12.11TEMP � Temporary bits for 16-bit Access
The TEMP register is used for single-cycle, 16-bit access to the 16-bit timer/counter registers by the CPU. The DMA
controller has a separate temporary storage register. There is one common TEMP register for all the 16-bit Timer/counter
registers.
For more details, refer to �Accessing 16-bit Registers� on page 13.
13.12.12CNTL � Counter register Low
The CNTH and CNTL register pair represents the 16-bit value, CNT. CNT contains the 16-bit counter value in the
timer/counter. CPU and DMA write access has priority over count, clear, or reload of the counter.
For more details on reading and writing 16-bit registers, refer to �Accessing 16-bit Registers� on page 13.
? Bit 7:0 � CNT[7:0]: Counter low byte

13.12.16CCxL � Compare or Capture x register Low
The CCxH and CCxL register pair represents the 16-bit value, CCx. These 16-bit register pairs have two functions,
depending of the mode of operation.
For capture operation, these registers constitute the second buffer level and access point for the CPU and DMA.
For compare operation, these registers are continuously compared to the counter value. Normally, the outputs form the
comparators are then used for generating waveforms.
CCx registers are updated with the buffer value from their corresponding CCxBUF register when an UPDATE condition
occurs.
? Bit 7:0 � CCx[7:0]: Compare or Capture x low byte

The PERBUFH and PERBUFL register pair represents the 16-bit value, PERBUF. This 16-bit register serves as the
buffer for the period register (PER). Accessing this register using the CPU or DMA will affect the PERBUFV flag.
